# Some Academically Useful Scripts
This repository houses some scripts that I have created during my academic journey to aid in my learning. These scripts were usually made to help me double check my answers while studying, or simplifying a really long solution to be shorter.

1. Densely-Packed Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) Converter
    - [Densely-Packed BCD Converter Python Script](./DenselyPackedBCDCalculator.py)
    - This script accepts three packed BCD groups to represent three digits and converts to densely-packed BCD.
    - Sample usage:
        ```
        Input: 0110 1001 0010
        Output: 1100111010    
        ```
    - A future update will allow it to accept a three-digit decimal number.
